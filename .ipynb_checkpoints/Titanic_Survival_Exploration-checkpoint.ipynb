    "In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this introductory project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, you will need to implement several conditional predictions and answer the questions below. Your project submission will be evaluated based on the completion of the code and your responses to the questions.\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "To begin working with the RMS Titanic passenger data, we'll first need to `import` the functionality we need, and load our data into a `pandas` DataFrame.  \n",
    "Run the code cell below to load our data and display the first few entries (passengers) for examination using the `.head()` function.\n",
    "> **Tip:** You can run a code cell by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift + Enter** or **Shift + Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the hotbar after selecting it. Markdown cells (text cells like this one) can be edited by double-clicking, and saved using these same shortcuts. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) allows you to write easy-to-read plain text that can be converted to HTML."

    "Using just the **Sex** feature for each passenger, we are able to increase the accuracy of our predictions by a significant margin. Now, let's consider using an additional feature to see if we can further improve our predictions. Consider, for example, all of the male passengers aboard the RMS Titanic: Can we find a subset of those passengers that had a higher rate of survival? Let's start by looking at the **Age** of each male, by again using the `survival_stats` function. This time, we'll use a fourth parameter to filter out the data so that only passengers with the **Sex** 'male' will be included.  \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on what you've accomplished here! You should now have an algorithm for predicting whether or not a person survived the Titanic disaster, based on their features. In fact, what you have done here is a manual implementation of a simple machine learning model, the _decision tree_. In a decision tree, we split the data into smaller groups, one feature at a time. Each of these splits will result in groups that are more homogeneous than the original group, so that our predictions become more accurate. The advantage of having a computer do things for us is that it will be more exhaustive and more precise than our manual exploration above. [This link](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) provides another introduction into machine learning using a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is just one of many algorithms that fall into the category of _supervised learning_. In this Nanodegree, you'll learn about supervised learning techniques first. In supervised learning, we concern ourselves with using features of data to predict or model things with objective outcome labels. That is, each of our datapoints has a true outcome value, whether that be a category label like survival in the Titanic dataset, or a continuous value like predicting the price of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5\n",
    "*Can you think of an example of where supervised learning can be applied?*  \n",
    "**Hint:** Be sure to note the outcome variable to be predicted and at least two features that might be useful for making the predictions."
